#bingWallpaper

This is a simple python based program that downloads bing wallpaper everytime you login and sets it as the desktop wallpaper from gnome.

OS	:	Ubuntu

How to setup?
<ul>
<li>First place the whole directory in proper place. By proper place I mean somewhere where permissions are not elevated and you do not modify the directory very often.</li>
<li>Now open terminal and go that directory.</li>
<li>type python startup.py</li>
</ul>

This should do the work.
